Thooval Version 1.0
===================
It is an assistive technology application to teach writing alphabets in Malayalam.

Installation :

First install the processing2.0 or above (an open source programming language). You have to import the library $1 Unistroke Recognizer and ezGestures. They can be found in the following url: http://processing.org/reference/libraries. Make a new directory inside the sketchbook folder and name it THOOVAL. Now copy 'THOOVAL.pde' and the contents inside Data folder to that folder. Open 'THOOVAL.pde' using the processing tool. If it doesn't show/load all the classes from 'pde/ ' folder separately do add it manually. If at-least one of the class is missing, the program wont run. You can add the classes by copying the contents of each 'pde' files into the class 'THOOVAL.pde'. It looks better if you add all the classes in a new tab.

Usage :

Run the program. Select the alphabet you need to learn. Now the corresponding alphabet will be displayed on the blackboard. The arrows inside the alphabet shows how to write it. Drag the mouse over that image following the arrows. Keep your mouse pressed till the completion of a letter.
